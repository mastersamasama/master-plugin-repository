# Curator Rebalance

Fetch optimal yield rebalance actions from the curator optimizer API and execute them sequentially on-chain via Agentic Wallet. Supports one-shot and loop mode for continuous rebalancing.

For API schema details, see [references/api-reference.md](references/api-reference.md).
For onchainos execution patterns, see [references/execution-patterns.md](references/execution-patterns.md).

## Skill Routing

- Wallet login/status → `okx-agentic-wallet`
- Token search by name → `okx-dex-token`
- Wallet balance queries → `okx-wallet-portfolio`
- Security scanning → `okx-security`
- DeFi product discovery → `okx-defi-invest`

## Pre-flight Checks

> Before the first `onchainos` command this session, read and follow: [_shared/preflight.md](_shared/preflight.md)

## Config File

Path: `/tmp/alpha-yield-config.json`

Used to persist parameters between loop iterations. Created after the first confirmed execution.

```json
{
  "chainId": 8453,
  "tokenAddress": "0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913",
  "userAddress": "0x655ca1a45e2603a4a2f10f7b6ba138740d47f1f5",
  "investAmount": null,
  "stepPercent": 5,
  "apyDiffThreshPercent": 0.5,
  "tokenDecimals": 6,
  "tokenSymbol": "USDC",
  "autoExecute": true
}
```

## Operation Modes

### Mode Detection

1. Check if `/tmp/alpha-yield-config.json` exists and `autoExecute: true`
   - **Yes** → **Loop Auto Mode** (skip to Step 2 with saved params, auto-execute)
   - **No** → **Interactive Mode** (full flow with user prompts and confirmation)

### Interactive Mode (First Run)

Use this on the first invocation or when no config file exists.

#### Step 0: Wallet Authentication

1. Run `onchainos wallet status` → check if logged in
2. If not logged in → guide user to login (→ `okx-agentic-wallet`)
3. Run `onchainos wallet addresses` → get user's EVM address for the target chain

#### Step 1: Collect Parameters

**You MUST explicitly ask the user to configure the following rebalance parameters before proceeding.** Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to present each parameter group. If the user chooses to skip or selects "Use defaults", apply the default values listed below. Do NOT silently assume defaults — always prompt first.

**Parameter reference:**

| Param | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `chainId` | Long | Yes | `8453` (Base) | Chain ID. User input or default. |
| `tokenAddress` | String | Yes | — | Token contract address, or resolve symbol via `okx-dex-token` |
| `userAddress` | String | Yes | — | From wallet addresses (Step 0) or user-provided |
| `investAmount` | String | No | user's token balance | Upper limit on total invest amount (in token minimal units). Capped at user's actual token balance. Omit to use full balance. |
| `stepPercent` | BigDecimal | No | `5` | Rebalance step size as percentage (5 = 5%). Controls granularity of allocation changes. |
| `apyDiffThreshPercent` | BigDecimal | No | `0.5` | Minimum APY difference (in percentage points) to trigger rebalance. |

**Prompting flow:**

1. **Chain & Token** — Ask the user which chain and token to rebalance. Present common choices (e.g., USDC on Base) and allow custom input. Briefly explain:
   - `chainId`: The blockchain network to operate on (e.g., 8453 = Base, 1 = Ethereum mainnet, 42161 = Arbitrum). Default: **8453 (Base)**.
   - `tokenAddress`: The contract address of the token to rebalance across yield protocols. You can provide a token symbol (e.g., "USDC") and we'll resolve the address automatically.

2. **Wallet Address** — Confirm the `userAddress` obtained from Step 0. If the wallet has multiple addresses, ask which one to use. Briefly explain:
   - `userAddress`: Your wallet address that holds the token positions. This is used to look up your current allocations and balances.

3. **Invest Amount** — Before asking, query the user's actual token balance on-chain (use `okx-wallet-portfolio` or equivalent) so you can display the real amount. Then ask whether the user wants to deploy the full balance or cap at a specific amount, showing the actual balance in the prompt. For example: "You have **1,023.45 USDC** on Base. Deploy the full amount, or cap at a specific amount?" Briefly explain:
   - `investAmount`: The maximum amount of tokens to allocate across yield protocols. Set a cap if you don't want to put all your tokens to work (e.g., "only use 500 of my 1,023.45 USDC"). Default: **your full token balance** (the queried amount).

4. **Advanced Tuning** — Ask the user to configure step size and APY threshold, or use defaults. Present the options with brief explanations:
   - `stepPercent`: Controls how much of your portfolio moves in each rebalance step. Lower = finer-grained but more transactions and gas. Higher = fewer transactions but coarser moves. Default: **5** (5% per step).
   - `apyDiffThreshPercent`: The minimum APY improvement (in percentage points) required to trigger a rebalance. Prevents rebalancing for trivial yield differences that wouldn't justify gas costs. Lower = more sensitive. Default: **0.5** (rebalance only if APY improves by ≥0.5%).

For each prompt, if the user selects "Skip" or otherwise indicates they want defaults, use the default values. After all parameters are collected (or defaulted), display a confirmation summary of all chosen values before proceeding to Step 2.

Resolve token decimals and symbol if the user provides a token name instead of address.
If the user wants to limit how much capital to deploy, ask for the amount and convert to minimal units (`userAmount × 10^decimals`) for `investAmount`. If omitted, the optimizer uses the user's full token balance.

#### Step 2: Fetch Rebalance Actions

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "${CURATOR_API_URL:-https://api.alpha-yield.com}/api/v1/rebalance" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chainId":<chainId>,"tokenAddress":"<tokenAddress>","userAddress":"<userAddress>","stepPercent":<stepPercent>,"apyDiffThreshPercent":<apyDiffThreshPercent>}'
```

Add `"investAmount":"<investAmount>"` to the JSON body if specified (as a string).

Parse response directly (no `data` wrapper). Filter `recommendations[]` for actionable items: `action != "HOLD"` and `calldata != null`.

Note: BigInt fields (`totalValue`, `currentAmount`, `targetAmount`, `delta`, `lockedAmount`, `totalWithdrawable`, `totalLocked`) are serialized as **strings**.

- If API unreachable → "Curator optimizer service not reachable. Ensure the service is running."
- If HTTP error → display error response
- If no actionable items → "Current allocation is already optimal (APY: X.XX%)"

#### Step 3: Display & Confirm

Show a summary table with APY improvement and each action:

```
Curator Rebalance Plan — <tokenSymbol> on Base
Current APY: XX.XX%  →  Optimal APY: XX.XX%  (+X.XX%)
Total Value: X.XX <tokenSymbol>

#  Action    Protocol      Pool (abbrev)    Current       Target        Delta
1  WITHDRAW  Morpho Blue   0x9a67...ac17    1.12 USDC     0.80 USDC    -0.32
2  APPROVE   Aave V3       0xabcd...1234    —             —             —
3  SUPPLY    Aave V3       0xabcd...1234    0.00 USDC     0.32 USDC    +0.32
```

- Convert amounts from minimal units using token decimals: `amount / 10^decimals`
- Convert APY from decimal to percentage: `apy * 100`
- Abbreviate pool IDs to first 4 + last 4 hex chars

Since the user already explicitly confirmed their rebalance parameters in Step 1, **skip the execution confirmation** — proceed directly to Step 4. The parameter collection step serves as the user's intent to rebalance; asking again is redundant.

Still display the summary table above so the user can see what will happen, but do NOT ask for approval — just proceed to execute immediately after showing it.

#### Step 4: Execute Actions

For each actionable recommendation, in array order:

```bash
onchainos wallet contract-call \
  --to <recommendation.targetContract> \
  --chain <chainId> \
  --from <userAddress> \
  --input-data <recommendation.calldata>
```

Always pass `--from <userAddress>` so the call is signed by the target wallet rather than whichever account happens to be active. Without it, a mismatch between the logged-in signer and the `userAddress` used for the optimizer request causes `transferFrom reverted` at SUPPLY time.

Execution rules:
- Execute strictly in array order
- Wait for txHash confirmation before next step
- **Never** pass `--force` on first invocation
- If `contract-call` returns `{"confirming": true}` → display message, wait for user confirmation, re-run with `--force`
- If any step fails → **STOP immediately**. Report completed steps (with txHashes) and the failed step with error details
- Display progress: `Step 1/3: WITHDRAW from Morpho Blue ... txHash: 0xabc... [done]`

> For detailed error handling, see [references/execution-patterns.md](references/execution-patterns.md).

#### Step 5: Save Config & Report

After successful execution:

1. **Save config** to `/tmp/alpha-yield-config.json` with all params and `"autoExecute": true`
2. **Display summary**:
   ```
   Rebalance complete.
   Previous APY: XX.XX%  →  New APY: XX.XX%
   Transactions: [txHash1, txHash2, ...]
   Config saved — subsequent loop iterations will auto-execute.
   ```
3. **Suggest next steps**:
   - Check updated balance → `okx-wallet-portfolio`
   - Set up recurring rebalance → `/loop 10m /curator-rebalance`

### Loop Auto Mode (Subsequent Runs)

When `/tmp/alpha-yield-config.json` exists with `autoExecute: true`:

1. **Load config** — read all params from the config file
2. **Verify wallet** — run `onchainos wallet status` to ensure still logged in. If not, log error and stop (do not prompt in auto mode).
3. **Fetch rebalance actions** (same as Interactive Step 2)
4. **Evaluate**:
   - If no actionable items → log: `[alpha-yield] No rebalance needed. Current APY: XX.XX%. Sleeping until next loop.` — done
   - If actionable items exist → proceed to auto-execute
5. **Auto-execute** (same as Interactive Step 4, but **skip user confirmation**):
   - Execute each actionable recommendation via `contract-call` in order
   - On confirming response → auto-confirm with `--force` (user pre-approved via first-run confirmation)
   - On failure → classify error and handle per [references/loop-error-handling.md](references/loop-error-handling.md)
6. **Report**: Log brief execution summary
   ```
   [alpha-yield] Rebalanced. APY: XX.XX% → XX.XX%. Steps: 3/3 completed. TxHashes: [...]
   ```

> For error classification, circuit breaker, gas pre-checks, and recovery procedures in loop mode, see [references/loop-error-handling.md](references/loop-error-handling.md).

### Stopping Auto Mode

To stop automatic rebalancing:
- Delete config: `rm /tmp/alpha-yield-config.json`
- Or stop the loop command
- Or set `"autoExecute": false` in the config file

**When the user stops the alpha-yield loop or auto mode**, always prompt them with the option to withdraw all positions:

> "Auto-rebalance stopped. Would you like to withdraw all positions back to your wallet?"

If the user confirms, proceed to the **Withdraw All** flow below. If not, leave positions as-is.

### Withdraw All Positions

Withdraws all managed positions across protocols back to the user's wallet. Can be triggered:
- Automatically when stopping auto mode (prompted)
- Standalone by user request (e.g., "withdraw all from curator", "exit all yield positions")

#### Flow

1. **Resolve parameters** — use `chainId`, `tokenAddress`, and `userAddress` from the existing config (`/tmp/alpha-yield-config.json`) if available. If no config exists, ask the user for these values (same as Interactive Step 1, but only chain/token/address — no need for stepPercent or apyDiffThreshPercent).

2. **Fetch withdraw-all actions**:
   ```bash
   curl -sS -X POST "${CURATOR_API_URL:-https://api.alpha-yield.com}/api/v1/rebalance/withdraw-all" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"chainId":<chainId>,"tokenAddress":"<tokenAddress>","userAddress":"<userAddress>"}'
   ```

3. **Display summary & confirm** — This is a high-impact action, so **always ask for confirmation**:
   ```
   Withdraw All — <tokenSymbol> on Base
   Total withdrawable: X.XX <tokenSymbol>
   Locked (non-withdrawable): X.XX <tokenSymbol>

   #  Action    Protocol      Pool (abbrev)    Amount
   1  WITHDRAW  Morpho Blue   0x9a67...ac17    2.32 USDC
   ```
   - Convert amounts from minimal units using token decimals (amounts are **strings**, parse accordingly)
   - Show `totalWithdrawable` and `totalLocked` from the response
   - If `totalLocked > 0`, inform the user that some funds are locked and cannot be withdrawn immediately

4. **Execute** — Same sequential execution as Interactive Step 4: run each `WITHDRAW` recommendation via `contract-call` in array order, wait for txHash confirmation between steps, stop on failure.

5. **Cleanup & Report**:
   - Delete `/tmp/alpha-yield-config.json` after successful full withdrawal
   - Display summary:
     ```
     Withdrawal complete.
     Withdrawn: X.XX <tokenSymbol> across N protocols.
     Transactions: [txHash1, txHash2, ...]
     Config removed.
     ```
   - If `totalLocked > 0`: "Note: X.XX <tokenSymbol> remains locked and was not withdrawn."

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CURATOR_API_URL` | `https://api.alpha-yield.com` | Base URL for the curator optimizer API |

## Edge Cases

- **All HOLD / no actionable items**: "No rebalance needed" — in loop mode, log `OK` and continue
- **`shouldRebalance: true` but no actionable items**: "Allocation already optimal"
- **Config file corrupted/invalid**: Fall back to interactive mode
