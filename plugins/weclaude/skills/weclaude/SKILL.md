# WeClaude — Buyer & Seller Operations

WeClaude is a pay-per-use Claude API proxy. **Buyers** pay USDG on X Layer via x402, get an API key, and use it with any Anthropic or OpenAI-compatible SDK. **Sellers** contribute their Claude OAuth tokens to the pool and earn usage stats. Pricing is real token usage. Unused balance can be withdrawn at any time.

## Skill Routing

- Wallet setup / login / token balance → use `okx-agentic-wallet`
- Token swaps → use `okx-dex-swap`
- x402 payments to other services (not WeClaude) → use `okx-x402-payment`

## Pre-flight Checks

> Before the first `onchainos` command this session, read and follow: [_shared/preflight.md](_shared/preflight.md)

## Server

**`https://api.weclaude.cc`** — verify with `curl -s "https://api.weclaude.cc/health"` before proceeding.

---

## Getting the Wallet Address

WeClaude uses X Layer (chainIndex 196). To get the user's X Layer address:

**Step 1 — Check login:**
```bash
onchainos wallet status
```
If `data.loggedIn` is `false`, ask the user to log in (`onchainos wallet login`), then re-check.

**Step 2 — Get the X Layer address:**
```bash
onchainos wallet addresses
```
Parse the JSON output and extract `data.xlayer[0].address`. This is the payer/seller address for all WeClaude operations.

> **Do NOT** use `onchainos wallet status` to get the address — it only returns login info, not addresses.
> **Do NOT** pass `--chain` to `onchainos wallet addresses` — chain filtering is not supported and will error.

## Buyer Operations

For step-by-step details, see [references/buyer-operations.md](references/buyer-operations.md).

### Topup — Get or Recharge an API Key

**Trigger**: user wants a Claude API key, buy credits, top up, or onboard.

**Flow:**
1. `POST /v1/buyer/topup[/<amount>]` → server returns **402** with payment details and the exact `onchainos` sign command
2. Detect payer address: `onchainos wallet addresses` → `data.xlayer[0].address`
3. **Confirm** amount + addresses with user — **STOP until confirmed**
4. Sign: run the `onchainos payment x402-pay --accepts '[…]' --from <YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>` command from the 402 body's `instructions[1]` field, substituting `PAYER_ADDRESS` for the placeholder.
5. POST the raw sign result back: `POST /v1/buyer/topup[/<amount>]` with JSON body `{"signature":"...","authorization":{...}}`
6. Present API key + configure Claude Code (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.weclaude.cc` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)

The server handles x402 header assembly internally — just send the raw `onchainos` output back.

Tiers: `$0.10` (default), `$0.50`, `$1.00`, `$5.00`. Same wallet tops up existing balance, returns same key.

### Balance — Check Remaining Credits

**Trigger**: user wants to check balance or usage.

- By API key: `curl -s "https://api.weclaude.cc/v1/buyer/balance" -H "Authorization: Bearer <KEY>"`
- By wallet: `curl -s "https://api.weclaude.cc/v1/buyer/balance?payer=<ADDRESS>"` — also returns the `api_key` (use this to recover a lost key)

### Withdraw — Refund Unused Balance

**Trigger**: user wants to withdraw, refund, or get remaining USDG back.

1. **Confirm** with user — this sends funds on-chain. **STOP until confirmed.**
2. `POST /v1/buyer/withdraw` with Bearer token
3. Present the `message` field directly — it's the final user-facing output
4. API key is **kept** after withdrawal — user can top up again later

If refund fails (`status: "refund_failed"`), balance stays intact. Suggest retry later.

## Seller Operations

For step-by-step details, see [references/seller-operations.md](references/seller-operations.md).

Each seller wallet maps to exactly one OAuth account (1:1, like buyer wallet → API key).

### Register as Seller — Contribute Claude OAuth Token

**Trigger**: user wants to contribute their Claude account, become a seller, share their token.

1. Get X Layer address via `onchainos wallet addresses` → `data.xlayer[0].address` (see "Getting the Wallet Address")
2. `POST /v1/seller/auth/start {"seller_address": "0x..."}` — get `auth_url` + `state`
3. Tell user to visit `auth_url`, log into Claude, approve, then **paste the callback URL** (localhost:54545 page won't load — expected)
4. **STOP. Wait for user to paste URL.**
5. `POST /v1/seller/auth/complete {"state": "...", "callback_url": "<pasted>"}` — token added to pool

409 = address already registered. Auth session expires in 5 minutes.

### Seller Status — Check Account Stats

**Trigger**: seller wants to check usage stats, request count, tokens served.

`GET /v1/seller/status?address=<SELLER_ADDRESS>` — returns total_requests, total tokens, earned_usd, status.

### Seller Earnings — Check Earnings Breakdown

**Trigger**: seller wants to check earnings, how much they've earned, claimable balance.

1. Get X Layer address via `onchainos wallet addresses` → `data.xlayer[0].address`
2. `GET /v1/seller/earn?address=<SELLER_ADDRESS>` — returns earned, claimed, claimable amounts
3. Present the earnings breakdown to user

### Seller Claim — Withdraw Earnings as USDG

**Trigger**: seller wants to claim earnings, withdraw seller earnings, get paid.

1. Get X Layer address via `onchainos wallet addresses` → `data.xlayer[0].address`
2. Check earnings first: `GET /v1/seller/earn?address=<SELLER_ADDRESS>`
3. If `claimable_usd` > 0, **confirm** with user — this sends funds on-chain. **STOP until confirmed.**
4. `POST /v1/seller/claim {"seller_address": "<ADDRESS>"}` — sends USDG to seller wallet
5. Present the `message` field — it's the final user-facing output

Minimum claim: $0.01. If claim fails (`status: "payout_failed"`), earnings stay intact. Suggest retry later.

### Seller Revoke — Stop Sharing and Remove Account

**Trigger**: seller wants to stop sharing, revoke their account, remove from pool, unregister, stop being a seller.

1. Get X Layer address via `onchainos wallet addresses` → `data.xlayer[0].address`
2. **Confirm** with user — this removes their account from the pool and auto-claims any unclaimed earnings on-chain. **STOP until confirmed.**
3. `POST /v1/seller/auth/revoke {"seller_address": "<ADDRESS>"}` — removes account, auto-claims earnings
4. Present the response: revocation status, auto-claimed amount, payout tx

The account record stays in the database (status: `revoked`) for history. The seller can re-register later by starting a new OAuth flow.

If auto-claim fails, the revoke is aborted — earnings are not lost. Suggest retry later.

## API Compatibility

| Format | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Anthropic (native) | `POST /v1/messages` |
| OpenAI-compatible | `POST /v1/chat/completions` |
| Responses API | `POST /v1/responses` |

Point any SDK at `https://api.weclaude.cc` as the base URL. List models: `GET /v1/models`.

## Edge Cases

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Server unreachable | `curl https://api.weclaude.cc/health` — may be temporarily down. |
| HTTP status is not 402 on topup | Show body — x402 middleware may be misconfigured. |
| Repeated 402 on topup replay | Check: (1) Is `Content-Type: application/json` set? (2) Does the body have `signature` and `authorization` fields? (3) Is the signature fresh (not expired)? |
| Wallet not logged in | Guide user: `onchainos wallet login` |
| Signing fails | Report error, offer retry or cancel. |
| Zero balance on withdraw | Nothing to withdraw — inform user. |
| Same wallet topups again | Server tops up existing balance, returns same API key. |
| Invalid or lost API key | Look up by wallet: `GET /v1/buyer/balance?payer=0x...` — returns `api_key`. For withdraw, topup first. |
| `X-WeClaude-Warning: low_balance` response header | Balance below $1. Present on **every** API response (streaming and non-streaming). Proactively warn the user and suggest topping up. |
| `X-WeClaude-Balance` response header | Current balance as a decimal string (e.g. `0.043210`). Present on every gated API response. Use for client-side balance tracking. |
| `_weclaude.warning: "low_balance"` in response body | Same as above but only in non-streaming JSON responses. Includes `topup_tiers` URLs. |
| Balance $0.000000 after usage | Balance depleted. The 402 response includes `topup_tiers` and step-by-step `instructions` — follow them to top up. Same wallet, same API key. |
| Insufficient balance 402 on API call | Read the 402 body — it includes `topup_tiers` and `instructions` for the x402 payment flow. No need to reconfigure after topup. |
| Larger topup | Tiers: `/v1/buyer/topup/0.5`, `/v1/buyer/topup/1.0`, `/v1/buyer/topup/5.0`. |
| Seller auth 409 | Address already has an active account — show `account_id`. |
| Seller auth expired | 5-minute window passed. Start new flow. |
| Token exchange fails | Claude OAuth issue — retry. Browser session may have expired. |
| Seller status 404 | Not registered yet — guide through seller registration. |
| Seller claim below minimum | Less than $0.01 claimable — inform user and show current earnings. |
| Seller claim payout fails | Earnings unchanged. Suggest retry later. |
| Seller earn 404 | Not registered — guide through seller registration. |
| Seller revoke 409 | Account already revoked. |
| Seller revoke auto-claim fails | Revoke aborted, earnings unchanged. Suggest retry later. |
| Seller revoke 429 | Claim in progress — wait and retry. |
| Seller wants to re-register after revoke | Start new OAuth flow — `POST /v1/seller/auth/start`. |
